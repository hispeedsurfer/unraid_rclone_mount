# rclone VFS mounting for Unraid & Systemd with MergerFS

This is a collection of scripts/Systemd service files for both Unraid users and Linux users using systemd. 

Made some improvements to VFS performance by writing the memory buffer from rclone to your disk limited to 4GB.
Stops rclone from hogging memory and lets it save the cache and file buffer to disk.
